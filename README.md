## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0 or later)
- A modern web browser with webcam access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Yoga_AI_reactJS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Yoga_AI_reactJS
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üìñ How to Use

1. From the home page, click on "Get Started" to access the pose selection page
2. Browse through the available yoga poses and select one to practice
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Position yourself in front of the camera and attempt to match the selected pose
5. The application will analyze your posture in real-time and provide feedback
6. Follow the on-screen guidance to correct your form
7. Practice regularly to improve your yoga technique!

## üìö Available Poses

The application currently supports the following yoga poses:

- **Padmasana** (Lotus Pose) - Helps deepen meditation by calming the mind
- **Vrksasana** (Tree Pose) - Improves balance, focus, and mental clarity
- **Tadasana** (Mountain Pose) - Improves posture and lengthens the spine
- **Utkatasana** (Chair Pose) - Strengthens thighs, ankles, and tones shoulders
- **Virbhadrasana** (Warrior Pose) - Increases stamina and overall body strength
- **Devi Asana** (Goddess Pose) - Strengthens hips, lower back, and thigh muscles

## üß† How It Works

Yoga AI Assistant uses TensorFlow.js and the PoseNet model to detect key points on the human body through the webcam. The application:

1. Captures video input from your webcam
2. Processes each frame through the PoseNet model to identify 17 key body points
3. Compares the angles and positions of these points with the correct pose
4. Provides real-time feedback on which body parts need adjustment
5. Displays visual indicators for correct and incorrect posture
